Setup finished!


- All Nodes in your `nodeSelector` selection are now candidates for an election to a master-node.
- After that election the new master was starting a kube-keepalived-vip pod which executed the script in the configmap-script.yaml
- The floatingip1 will now point to the newly elected master.
- You can review that in your Hetzner Cloud console GUI.
- Kill now the node where the floatingip1 is pointing to.
- The ReplicationController is then deploying a new keepalived pod on one of your selected nodes.
- keepalived is now running its script and corrects the floatingip1 to the new node (the same where it sits on).

You now have a maximum downtime of your LoadBalancer Nodes of a few (~12) seconds. :-)


Nice, Isn't it?

If you have troubles try `kubectl logs kube-keepalived-vip-XXXX` or dig into the container keepalived-vip container/pod.
